# üîß PrognosAI: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System Using Time-Series Sensor Data

> An intelligent system for estimating Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machinery using deep learning and multivariate time-series sensor data from the NASA CMAPSS dataset.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**PrognosAI** is a predictive maintenance system designed to reduce unplanned equipment downtime by forecasting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using AI techniques. The system leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models trained on time-series sensor data, enabling maintenance teams to act before critical failures occur.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Estimate RUL of engines and other industrial assets from sensor data.
- Enable timely, data-driven maintenance decisions.
- Visualize degradation trends and trigger maintenance alerts using thresholds.
- Generalize across similar assets like turbines, pumps, and motors.
