Milestone 2: Model Development & Training

Overview:
This milestone develops and trains a time-series deep learning model (LSTM/GRU) to learn patterns from multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction. The model is prototyped on the NASA CMAPSS dataset as part of the broader AI-PrognosAI Predictive Maintenance System

Objectives:
Implement an LSTM or GRU architecture for RUL regression.
Train the model on rolling window sensor sequences and computed RUL targets.
Monitor loss convergence and inspect initial validation results.

Installation:
Clone the repo and install requirements:

git clone https://github.com/youruser/ai-prognosai.git
cd ai-prognosai
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset:
Ensure that the CMAPSS dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and placed in the data/ folder

Usage:
Train the RUL Model
bash
python train.py --data_path ./data/train.csv --model lstm --epochs 30 --batch_size
Adjust script arguments for different datasets/models as needed.

Script functions:

loader.py loads and formats sensor data for sequence modeling.
window.py converts raw data to rolling window sequences.
rul.py provides RUL computation logic.
model.py builds and trains the deep learning model.
train.py runs the full experiment and saves weights/checkpoints.

Deliverables:

Implemented LSTM or GRU model architecture.
Trained model weights/checkpoints.
Training and validation loss curves.
Code for model definition, training, and saving.

Evaluation:

Check loss reduction during training for convergence.
Use validation plots to inspect predicted vs. actual RUL curves.
Confirm proper implementation of the deep learning model.

Next Steps:
Proceed to Milestone 3 for rigorous model evaluation and test-set analysis using RMSE metrics and bias/error diagnostics.
